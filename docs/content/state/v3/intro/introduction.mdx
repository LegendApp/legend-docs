Version 3 is in Beta and you can use it by installing the @beta version. If you're starting a new project we suggest starting with version 3 since it's much improved over version 2.

See [Migrating](../../other/migrating) for details of the changes or [go back to the v2 docs](../../../v2).

Legend-State is a super fast all-in-one local and remote state library that helps you write less code to make faster apps. We think you'll love it because it brings some huge benefits:

### 1. Local and remote state

Legend-State handles local, global, and remote state all in one. Just `get()` and `set()` observables, and a robust sync engine makes sure your state is persisted locally and synced with your server.

### 2. Great DX and less code

Just `useValue` an observable to automatically re-render whenever it changes, and `set()` to update it. With the reduced boilerplate and everything that Legend-State does for you, you'll build better apps with less code.

```jsx
const state$ = observable({
    settings: { theme: 'dark' }
})

state$.settings.theme.set('light')

const Component = () => {
    const theme = useValue(state$.settings.theme)

    return <div>Theme: {theme}</div>
}
```

### 3. Fine grained reactivity for the best possible performance

Legend-State achieves much better performance than vanilla React and other state libraries because it does smaller re-renders less often, so your apps will load faster and run more smoothly.


## Legend-State has four primary goals:

### 1. 🦄 As easy as possible to use

There is no boilerplate and there are no contexts, actions, reducers, dispatchers, sagas, thunks, or epics. You can structure your data however you want in local state or global stores. It doesn't modify your data at all, and you can just call `get()` to get the raw data and `set()` to change it.

```jsx
import { observable, observe } from "@legendapp/state"
import { useValue } from "@legendapp/state/react"

// Observables can be primitives or deep objects
const settings$ = observable({
    theme: 'dark'
    // Computed observables with just a function
    isDark: () => settings$.theme.get() === 'dark'
})

// get returns the raw data
settings$.theme.get() // 'dark'
// set sets
settings$.theme.set('light')

// observing contexts re-run when tracked observables change
observe(() => {
    console.log(settings$.theme.get())
})

function Component() {
    const theme = useValue(state$.settings.theme)
    // useValue tracks get() calls to automatically re-render on changes
    const isDark = useValue(() => state$.settings.theme.get() === 'dark')

    return <div>Theme: {theme}</div>
}
```

Many examples in these docs are editable so you can play around with the code and see how it works.
</Callout>

<Editor
  code={`
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"
import { useValue } from "@legendapp/state/react"

// Create an observable object
const settings$ = observable({ theme: 'dark' })

// This is the code for the example on your right ----->
function Component() {
    // theme is automatically tracked for changes
    const theme = useValue(settings$.theme)

    const toggle = () => {
      settings$.theme.set(theme =>
        theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
      )
    }

    return (
      <Box theme={theme}>
        <div>Theme: {theme}</div>
        <Button theme={theme} onClick={toggle}>
          Toggle theme
        </Button>
      </Box>
    )
}`}
  noInline={true}
  renderCode=";render(<Component />)"
  previewWidth={180}
/>

### 2. ⚡️ The fastest React state library

Legend-State beats every other state library on just about every metric and is so optimized for arrays that it even beats vanilla JS in some benchmarks. At only `4kb` and with the massive reduction in boilerplate code, you'll have big savings in file size too.

See [Fast 🔥](../fast) for more details of why Legend-State is so fast.

### 3. 🔥 Fine-grained reactivity for minimal renders

Legend-State helps your re-renders be smaller and less frequent, making your apps faster 🔥.

<Editor
  code={`
import { observable } from "@legendapp/state"
import { Memo, useObservable } from "@legendapp/state/react"
import { useRef, useState } from "react"

function NormalComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1)
  const renderCount = useRef(1).current++

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount((v) => v + 1)
  }, 600)

  // This re-renders when count changes
  return (
    <FlashingDiv pad>
      <h5>Normal</h5>
      <div>Renders: {renderCount}</div>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
    </FlashingDiv>
  )
}
function FineGrained() {
  const count$ = useObservable(1)
  const renderCount = useRef(1).current++

  useInterval(() => {
    count$.set((v) => v + 1)
  }, 600)

  // The text updates itself so the component doesn't re-render
  return (
    <FlashingDiv pad>
      <h5>Fine-grained</h5>
      <div>Renders: {renderCount}</div>
      <div>Count: <Memo>{count$}</Memo></div>
    </FlashingDiv>
  )
}`}
  noInline={true}
  renderCode=";render(<div><NormalComponent /><div className='!mt-4' /><FineGrained /></div>)"
  previewWidth={150}
  transformCodePreset="flashing-count"
/>

### 4. 💾 Powerful sync and persistence

Legend-State includes a powerful [persistence and sync engine](../../sync/persist-sync). It easily enables local first apps by optimistically applying all changes locally first, retrying changes even after restart until they eventually sync, and syncing minimal diffs. We use Legend-State as the sync engines in [Legend](https://legendapp.com) and [Bravely](https://bravely.io), so it is by necessity very full featured while being simple to set up.

Local persistence plugins for the browser and React Native are included, with sync plugins for [Keel](https://www.keel.so), [Supabase](https://www.supabase.com), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), and `fetch`.

```js
const state$ = observable(
    users: syncedKeel({
        list: queries.getUsers,
        create: mutations.createUsers,
        update: mutations.updateUsers,
        delete: mutations.deleteUsers,
        persist: { name: 'users', retrySync: true },
        debounceSet: 500,
        retry: {
            infinite: true,
        },
        changesSince: 'last-sync',
    }),
    // direct link to my user within the users observable
    me: () => state$.users['myuid']
)

observe(() => {
    // get() activates through to state$.users and starts syncing.
    // it updates itself and re-runs observers when name changes
    const name = me$.name.get()
})

// Setting a value goes through to state$.users and saves update to server
me$.name.set('Annyong')
```
