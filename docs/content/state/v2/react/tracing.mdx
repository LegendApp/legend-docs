If you notice your components feeling too slow or seeming to render too often, two helpful functions can show you exactly what observables they're listening to and why they're rendering.

## useTraceListeners()

Call `useTraceListeners()` anywhere within `observer` or any React component to console.log a list of every observable being track for changes. This can help you find and reduce the number of listeners.

```jsx
import { useTraceListeners } from "@legendapp/state/trace";

const Component = observer(function Component(props) {
  // Call useTraceListeners anywhere inside the component
  useTraceListeners();

  return <div>{state.count.get()}</div>;

  /* This logs:

    [legend-state] tracking 1 observable:
    1: count

    */
});
```

## useTraceUpdates()

Call `useTraceUpdates()` anywhere within `observer` or any React component to console.log information about the observable change that causes each render. This can help you track down why components are rendering too often.

```jsx
import { useTraceUpdates } from "@legendapp/state/trace";

const Component = observer(function Component(props) {
  // Call useTraceUpdates anywhere inside the component
  useTraceUpdates();

  return <div>{state.count.get()}</div>;

  /* This logs:

    [legend-state] Rendering because "count" changed:
    from: 0
    to: 1

    */
});
```

## useVerifyNotTracking()

Call `useVerifyNotTracking()` anywhere within any React component to console.error if it is tracking anything. This is useful if you are going for fine-grained reactivity and want to make sure parent components are not tracking any observables.

```jsx
import { useVerifyNotTracking } from "@legendapp/state/trace";

const Component = observer(function Component(props) {
  // Call useVerifyNotTracking anywhere inside the component
  useVerifyNotTracking();

  // This will log an error because get() makes it track
  return <div>{state.count.get()}</div>;
});
const FineComponent = observer(function FineComponent(props) {
  // Call useVerifyNotTracking anywhere inside the component
  useVerifyNotTracking();

  // This will not log because rendering the observable directly
  // does not re-render this component
  return <div>{state.count}</div>;
});
```

## useVerifyOneRender()

Call `useVerifyOneRender()` anywhere within any React component to console.error if it renders more than once. This is useful if you and want to make sure components are not rendered more than once.

```jsx
import { useVerifyOneRender } from "@legendapp/state/trace";

const Component = observer(function Component(props) {
  // Call useVerifyOneRender anywhere inside the component
  useVerifyOneRender();

  // This will log an error after one render when count is updated
  return <div>{state.count.get()}</div>;
});
const Component = observer(function Component(props) {
  // Call useVerifyOneRender anywhere inside the component
  useVerifyOneRender();

  // This will not log because `get(false)` does not track observable
  // does not re-render this component
  return <div>{state.count.get(false)}</div>;
});
```

##### Note: All these hooks take name as an argument which can be used to identify which component is logging it

## What to do with this information

- You may want to call `get()` at a higher level in an object to only listen to it, and not every single child.
- Use a shallow listener with `get(true)` to only update when keys are added to or removed from the object.
- You may want to call `peek()` to not listen at all.

If you find an observable changing often and you're not sure why, you can put a breakpoint on the console log to catch it. Or add your own listener to the observable to watch every change:

```js
// Why is count rendering so often?
state.count.onChange(({ value }) => {
  console.log("Count changed", value);
  console.trace();
  debugger;
});
```
