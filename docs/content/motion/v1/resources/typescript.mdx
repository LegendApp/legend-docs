Legend-Motion tries to be as strongly typed as possible, with the `animate` prop autocompleting the available styles of the component, `animateProps` autocompleting the component's props, and the `transition` prop autocompleting only the properties that are animated.

If types are not working please ensure that you've installed both `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`.

```npm
npm install @types/react @types/react-native
```
