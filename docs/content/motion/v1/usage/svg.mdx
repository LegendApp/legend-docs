To use SVG animations, you'll need to additionally install `react-native-svg`. See [its documentation](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#installation) for details.

## Usage

SVG animations work by animating the props that you want to change, with the `animateProps` prop.

```jsx
<MotionSvg.Svg height="200" width="200">
  <MotionSvg.Rect
    stroke="#555"
    strokeWidth="1"
    animateProps={{
      fill: value ? "#F81FEC" : "#59B0F8",
      x: value ? "60" : "0",
      y: value ? "40" : "10",
      width: value ? "140" : "50",
      height: value ? "140" : "50",
    }}
    transition={{
      default: {
        type: "spring",
        damping: 20,
        stiffness: 300,
      },
      fill: {
        type: "tween",
        duration: 800,
      },
    }}
  />
</MotionSvg.Svg>
```

You can see in this example that we used a tween transition for the `fill` color and set a default spring transition for the rest of the props, because spring transitions don't look good on colors.
