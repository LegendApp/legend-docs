title: Custom Components
---

While Legend-Motion providers animated wrappers around built-in components, you may want to create animated versions of custom components.

`createMotionComponent` is the function that adds the `animate` and `transition` properties and creates the animation logic. You can use it to convert your own components to Motion components.

As an example:

```js
import { createMotionComponent } from "@legendapp/motion";

const AnimatedView = createMotionComponent(Animated.View);
```
