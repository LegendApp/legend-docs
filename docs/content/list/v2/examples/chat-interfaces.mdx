## Chat Interfaces Without `inverted`

In other list libraries if you wanted items to start scrolling from the bottom, you'd need to use an `inverted` prop, which would apply a negative scale transform. But that causes a lot of weird issues, so Legend List explicitly does not do that.

```ts
alignItemsAtEnd?: boolean;
maintainScrollAtEnd?: boolean;
maintainScrollAtEndThreshold?: number;
```

Instead, to align items at the end you can just use the `alignItemsAtEnd` prop, which will apply padding above items to fill the screen and stick them to the bottom.

The `maintainScrollAtEnd` prop will check if you are already scrolled to the bottom when `data` changes, and if so it keeps you scrolled to the bottom.

The `maintainScrollAtEndThreshold` prop (which defaults to 0.1) defines what percent of the screen counts as the bottom.

So using Legend List for a chat interface would look like this:

```tsx
  <LegendList
    data={items}
    renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.title}</Text>}
    estimatedItemSize={320}
    alignItemsAtEnd
    maintainScrollAtEnd
    maintainScrollAtEndThreshold={0.1}
  />
```
