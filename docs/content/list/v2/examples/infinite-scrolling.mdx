## Two-way infinite scrolling

```ts
onStartReached?: ((info: { distanceFromStart: number }) => void) | null | undefined;
onEndReached?: ((info: { distanceFromEnd: number }) => void) | null | undefined;
```

These callbacks fire when you scroll to the top or bottom of a list. This can be used to load more data in either direction. In a typical list you'll likely just use `onEndReached` to load more data when the users scrolls to the bottom.

If you have a chat-like interface you may want to load more messages as you scroll up, and you can use `onStartReached` for that. If you are doing that, you will very likely want to use [maintainVisibleContentPosition](../../api/props/##maintain-visible-content-position) so that the items loading above don't shift the viewport down.
