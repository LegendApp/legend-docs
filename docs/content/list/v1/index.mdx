# Legend List

Legend List is a high performance virtualized ScrollView library for React Native. Compared to FlatList and FlashList it's faster, simpler, and has useful features they don't support.

## Key Features

- ✨ **Extremely fast** - Optimized for high performance scrolling
- ✨ **Dynamic item sizes** - Automatically handles varying item heights
- ✨ **Optional recycling** - Choose when to enable view recycling for extra performance
- ✨ **Bidirectional infinite lists** - Support for infinite scrolling in both directions
- ✨ **Chat list without inverting** - Build chat interfaces without transform scaling issues
- ✨ **Maintain content view position** - Keep content stable when items change above viewport
- ✨ **Recycling hooks** - Built-in hooks to manage state in recycled views

## Quick Start

Install Legend List:

```bash
npm install @legendapp/list
# or
yarn add @legendapp/list
# or
pnpm add @legendapp/list
```

Basic usage:

```jsx
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { LegendList } from "@legendapp/list";

const items = [
  { id: "1", title: "Item 1" },
  { id: "2", title: "Item 2" },
  { id: "3", title: "Item 3" },
];

export function MyList() {
  return (
    <LegendList
      data={items}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.title}</Text>}
      keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
      recycleItems
    />
  );
}
```

## Version 1.0

Legend List recently reached 1.0. While we are confident that it's stable for use in production, the documentation is continuously being improved.

## Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS  
- React Native Web
- React Native MacOS
- React Native Windows (likely but untested)
- Any React Native platform should work since there's no native code
