## Timing

React Native's Animated does timing in milliseconds while Framer Motion does timing in seconds. Legend-Motion supports both options so you can use the timing configuration that matches the rest of your codebase.

```js
import { configureMotion } from "@legendapp/motion";

configureMotion({ timing: "s" });
```
