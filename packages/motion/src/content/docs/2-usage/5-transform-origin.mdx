A crucial animation feature that's missing from React Native Animated is `transformOrigin`. React Native does transformations from the center of the component, but sometimes you need to scale or rotate from one side. So Legend-Motion adds a `transformOrigin` prop.

You can see in the following example the difference between scaling from the top left vs. the bottom right.

<Example name="TransformOrigin">
  ```jsx
  <Motion.View
    animate={{ scale: value ? 1 : 0.5 }}
    transformOrigin={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
  />
  <Motion.View
    animate={{ scale: value ? 1 : 0.5 }}
    transformOrigin={{ x: "100%", y: "100%" }}
  />
  ```
</Example>

Possible values are a number of pixels or a percentage, and it defaults to `50%` as usual in React Native.

**Note**: Using `transformOrigin` adds a hook, so setting `transformOrigin` conditionally would cause crashes.
